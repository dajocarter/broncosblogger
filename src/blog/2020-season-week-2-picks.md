CIN @ CLE
Pick: CLE ‚úÖ
I don't feel good picking either team üòÜ. Bengals are just happy they had a chance to win last week and Browns looked like absolute dawg shit. I'm going to take the more talented team here in a short week with Cleveland. Otoh, my gawd the headlines if Mayfield shits the bed again and Burrow looks good in a win.

JAX @ TEN
Pick: TEN ‚úÖ
Tennessee looks the same team from last year if not better. Jacksonville is just lucky Philip Rivers carried the curse of 4th Quarter comebacks with him to the Colts.

CAR @ TB
Pick: TB ‚úÖ
The thing about the Patriots and Brady was that he was just a Stone Cold Mother Fucker and they always come back so I don't see him losing twice in a row especially to a rookie Head Coach. Tom Brady Revenge Pop-Up Show.

DEN @ PIT
Pick: PIT ‚úÖ
It feels awful to pick against my team this early in the year but I think team consistency and experience is going to a Big Key this year, especially in these early weeks without a preseason.

LAR @ PHI
Pick: LAR ‚úÖ
I'll admit I didn't watch the Sunday Night Football game and I don't care for NFC East teams so I don't know much about either team. I'm going with the team that won last week against an NFC East team that I thought would be better than this NFC East team.

SF @ NYJ
Pick: SF ‚úÖ
I don't think I can pick the Jets against anyone else but the Dolphins in late December at home. It must suck to be a Jets fan.

BUF @ MIA
Pick: BUF ‚úÖ
I don't care to look into the Dolphins schedule so I'm excited to see how long the opening losing streak lasts this year.

MIN @ IND
Pick: MIN ‚ùå
Minnesota looked awful but c'mon you can't beat the Jags?

DET @ GB
Pick: GB ‚úÖ
The Aaron Rodger revenge tour continues. It must really suck to be a Lions fan.

ATL @ DAL
Pick: ATL ‚ùå
SpidermanPointingSpiderman.jpeg Fuck Jerry Jones and the Cowboys. Why did I pick them last week again?

NYG @ CHI
Pick: CHI ‚úÖ
I don't care either way who wins this and I already forgot who I picked to win. Mitch Tribusky Revenge Tour continues.

WFT @ ARI
Pick: ARI ‚úÖ
I don't care for NFC East teams and I don't like east coast teams traveling to the west coast so I'm going with the team that just beat a pretty damn good Football Team in the 49ers.

KC @ LAC
Pick: KC ‚úÖ
One of the best teams in the AFC and the NFL beats the team that could barely beat a shitty team led by a rookie QuarterBack in his first start in a year with no preseason.

BAL @ HOU
Pick: BAL ‚úÖ
One of the best teams in the AFC and the NFL beats the team that traded away Deandre Hopkins.

NE @ SEA
Pick: NE ‚ùå
This is going to be a good one and I could see it going either way. Since it's so close I have to go with Belichick although I don't like an east coast team traveling to the west coast. The Cam Newton Revenge Tour continues.

NO @ LV
Pick: NO ‚ùå
No Michael Thomas but Fuck The Raiders. Did you see Jon Gruden's hair last week?
