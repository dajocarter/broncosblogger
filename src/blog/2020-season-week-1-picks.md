I never thought we'd get here but oh buddy am I ready for football. Without further ado, here are my inaugural picks for Week 1 of the 2020 NFL season.

IND @ JAX
Pick: IND ❌
Colts were a good team last year and with an upgrade at QB with Rivers, I see them easily beating a shitty Jaguars team.

CHI @ DET
Pick: DET ❌
I like the Chicago defense but I also like Detroit's offense. In a divisional matchup with no preseason, I'm going with the team that has the better Quarter Back.

LV @ CAR
Pick: LV ✅
I don't know what to expect from either team so I'm going with the one that has more consistency going into this season.

NYJ @ BUF
Pick: BUF ✅
It's hard to think of a worse team in the NFL than the Jets.

CLE @ BAL
Pick: BAL ✅
Baltimore was a great team last year and it feels like they got better this year. Browns can keep up but I don't see them taking this one.

SEA @ ATL
Pick: SEA ✅
I like both offenses but I like Seattle's defense better. Lrt Russell Cook.

LAC @ CIN
Pick: LAC ✅
I expect both teams to suck this year so I'm going with the team that has more experience at HC and QB.

ARI @ SF
Pick: SF ❌
In early divisional matchups I usually side with the home team but that doesn't matter much this year. I still the 49ers are better team and Arizona sucks until proven otherwise.

TB @ NO
Pick: TB ❌
The Bucs offense feels like Philly's Super Team and I can't bet against Tom Brady until I see otherwise.

DAL @ LAR
Pick: DAL ❌
Sean McVay is a genius but he prefers to yell at his players without a mask so that they can read his lips and body language better. Jared Goff is a dumbass until proven otherwise so I'm going withike McCarthy upgrades Dak Prescott. Fuck Jerry Jones and the Cowboys.

PIT @ NYG
Pick: PIT ✅
Big Ben's Back Baby! When has a Belicheck disciple ever worked? Vrabel only works because he was a player so he's a Player's Coach and not a complete fucking douchebag.

TEN @ DEN
Pick: DEN ❌
I can't pick against my team week 1 plus we shut down Henry to 16 yards last year.
